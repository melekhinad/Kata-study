Cruel, cruel world, must I go on?
Cruel, cruel world, I'm moving on
I've been living too fast
And I've been living too wrong
Cruel, cruel world, I'm gone

This big ol' world sure got me running 'round
I heard a voice that said, "Just settle down"
And with the moonlight as my guide
And with this feeling deep inside
I know now that I am homeward bound
